# 📘 JavaScript Core Concepts & Browser APIs Practice

Welcome to my JavaScript learning repository!  
This project is a collection of my notes, code examples, and mini-projects as I explore the core concepts of JavaScript and its interaction with web browsers.

## 🚀 About This Repository

The primary goal of this repository is to:

- Document my personal learning journey in JavaScript.
- Serve as a quick reference for essential topics.
- Provide hands-on examples of key JavaScript concepts and browser APIs.
- Explore everything from basic data structures to advanced browser-side capabilities.

Each topic includes clear examples and use cases to reinforce understanding.

## 📚 Topics Covered

This repository is structured around several essential JavaScript areas:

### 1. 🔧 Core JavaScript Fundamentals

- **Arrays**  
  Creation, manipulation, and iteration using methods like `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`, and more.

- **Objects**  
  Understanding object literals, nested structures, properties, methods, and practical use cases.

---

### 2. 🧱 DOM (Document Object Model) Manipulation

- **Selectors**  
  Accessing elements using `getElementById()`, `querySelector()`, and `getElementsByClassName()`.

- **Manipulation**  
  Dynamically creating, modifying, and removing HTML elements and content.

- **Events**  
  Responding to user interactions like clicks, mouse movements, and keyboard inputs.

---

### 3. 📋 HTML Forms

- **Form Handling**  
  Capturing and processing user input through various input types.

- **Form Validation**  
  Implementing client-side checks to ensure valid user input and give real-time feedback.

---

### 4. ⏱️ Asynchronous JavaScript

- **Timers**  
  Using `setTimeout()` to delay execution.

- **Intervals**  
  Repeating actions using `setInterval()` and stopping them with `clearInterval()`.

---

### 5. 💾 Browser Storage

- **localStorage**  
  Saving data that persists even after the browser is closed.

- **sessionStorage**  
  Storing data specific to a single session/tab.

- **Cookies**  
  Reading, writing, and managing small bits of data stored by the browser.

## 🌱 Future Learning

This is a living project!  
I plan to continue expanding it with more advanced topics like:

- Fetch API & AJAX
- Promises & async/await
- Modular JavaScript
- Web Components
- Small-scale JavaScript applications
