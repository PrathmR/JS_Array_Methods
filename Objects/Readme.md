🧩 JavaScript Objects Deep Dive
A beginner-friendly project for demonstrating the creation and manipulation of JavaScript objects.

🧠 What It Does

Runs JavaScript code that defines, modifies, and interacts with objects in various ways.

Logs the results to the browser's developer console, showing the output of different object operations.

Helps beginners understand core concepts of working with objects, which are fundamental building blocks in JavaScript.

✨ Features

Clear examples of key object concepts and methods.

Demonstrates different ways to create and structure data.

Modern, real-world JavaScript syntax.

Code runs instantly in any browser without any special setup.

Focuses entirely on logic, with output visible in the console.

🧪 Object Concepts & Methods Used

Object Literals – Creating an object (e.g., a book with title, author, price).

Property Access – Accessing properties using dot (.) and bracket ([]) notation.

Nested Objects – Creating objects within objects (e.g., a user with an address).

Object Methods – Defining functions as properties on an object.

Iterating – Looping through an object's keys and values using for...in.

Object.keys(), Object.values(), Object.entries() – Converting an object to an array.

Destructuring – Extracting specific properties (e.g., name and age) from an object.

Spread Operator (...) – Creating a shallow copy of an object.

Deep Copying – Creating a true, unlinked copy of a nested object.

Optional Chaining (?.) – Safely accessing properties of nested objects that may not exist.

Computed Properties – Using a variable as a property key.

this Keyword – Understanding context within an object's methods.
