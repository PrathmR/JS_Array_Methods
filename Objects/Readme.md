## ðŸ§ª Object Concepts & Methods Covered

- **Object Literals** â€“ Define objects like books with properties like title, author, and price.

- **Object Methods** â€“ Functions defined as properties of objects.
- **Iteration** â€“ Loop through keys and values using `for...in`.
- **Built-in Methods**:
  - `Object.keys()`
  - `Object.values()`
  - `Object.entries()`
- **Destructuring** â€“ Extract specific properties from objects.
- **Spread Operator (`...`)** â€“ Create shallow copies of objects.
- **Deep Copying** â€“ Clone nested objects without reference sharing.
- **Optional Chaining (`?.`)** â€“ Safely access nested properties.
- **Computed Properties** â€“ Dynamically define object keys using variables.
