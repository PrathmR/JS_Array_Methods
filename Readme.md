JavaScript Core Concepts & Browser APIs Practice
Welcome to my JavaScript learning repository! This project is a collection of my notes, code examples, and small projects as I journey through the fundamental concepts of JavaScript and its interaction with the web browser.

ðŸš€ About This Repository
The main goal of this repository is to document my learning process and create a personal reference for key JavaScript topics. It serves as a hands-on lab where I explore everything from basic data structures to advanced browser features. Each topic has its own set of examples to illustrate its usage and functionality.

ðŸ“š Topics Covered
This repository is organized into several key areas of JavaScript and Web APIs. Below is a summary of the concepts you can find here.

1. Core JavaScript Fundamentals
Arrays: Mastering array creation, manipulation, and iteration using methods like map(), filter(), reduce(), and more.

Objects: Understanding object literals, properties, methods, and how to work with complex data structures.

2. Document Object Model (DOM) Manipulation
Selectors: Grabbing elements from the HTML document using methods like getElementById(), querySelector(), and getElementsByClassName().

Manipulation: Dynamically creating, modifying, and deleting HTML elements and their content.

Events: Handling user interactions like clicks, mouse movements, and keyboard inputs.

3. HTML Forms
Form Handling: Capturing and processing user input from form fields.

Form Validation: Implementing client-side validation to ensure data integrity before submission, providing real-time feedback to users.

4. Asynchronous JavaScript
Timers: Using setTimeout() to execute code after a specified delay.

Intervals: Using setInterval() to run code repeatedly at fixed time intervals, and clearInterval() to stop it.

5. Browser Storage
localStorage: Persisting data on the user's browser that remains even after the browser window is closed.

sessionStorage: Storing data for a single session, which is cleared when the page session ends (i.e., the tab is closed).

Cookies: Understanding how to read, write, and manage small pieces of data sent from the web server and stored on the client's browser.

ðŸ’» How to Use This Repo
Feel free to clone or fork this repository to your local machine to run the examples.

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/PrathmR/JavaScript.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd your-repo-name

Most examples are contained within HTML files that can be opened directly in your web browser. You can also open the browser's developer tools (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I) to see console logs and interact with the code.

ðŸŒ± Future Learning
This is an ongoing project. I plan to continue adding more advanced topics and building small applications to solidify my understanding.

Happy Coding!
