# 🧩 JavaScript Objects Deep Dive

A beginner-friendly project showcasing the creation, manipulation, and exploration of JavaScript objects.

---

## 🧠 What It Does

- Defines, modifies, and interacts with JavaScript objects through runnable code.
- Logs output to the browser's Developer Console to visually demonstrate object operations.
- Helps beginners grasp key concepts of objects—essential building blocks of JavaScript.

---

## ✨ Features

1. ✅ Clear, beginner-friendly examples of object concepts and methods.
2. 🧱 Demonstrates various object creation and data structuring techniques.
3. 🚀 Uses modern, real-world JavaScript syntax.
4. 🌐 Runs in any modern browser without additional setup.
5. 🔍 Focuses entirely on logic with all output shown in the Developer Console.

## 🧪 Object Concepts & Methods Covered

- **Object Literals** – Define objects like books with properties like title, author, and price.
- **Property Access** – Use dot (`obj.prop`) and bracket (`obj['prop']`) notation.
- **Nested Objects** – Store objects within objects (e.g., user profiles with addresses).
- **Object Methods** – Functions defined as properties of objects.
- **Iteration** – Loop through keys and values using `for...in`.
- **Built-in Methods**:
  - `Object.keys()`
  - `Object.values()`
  - `Object.entries()`
- **Destructuring** – Extract specific properties from objects.
- **Spread Operator (`...`)** – Create shallow copies of objects.
- **Deep Copying** – Clone nested objects without reference sharing.
- **Optional Chaining (`?.`)** – Safely access nested properties.
- **Computed Properties** – Dynamically define object keys using variables.
